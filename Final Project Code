If people want your advice, they need to be prepared to handle the truth."

Joy personality message
Your goal is to make sure the people around you are happy. You tend to be optimistic even in the worst scenarios and
are determined to find the fun! You see challenges as opportunities and moments that will lead to something great!

Fear personality message 
You tend to be the protector and want to make sure everyone is safe. You're constantly on the lookout for danger and
sometimes tend to get too in your head. Try not to worry too much, be more in the moment!

Anger personality message
You are a fiery spirit and tend to let your emotions get the best of you when things dont go your way.
You are quick to overreact and have little patience when you believe things are unfair. Take a deep breath...

a little hard to be positive. Sometimes you just need a good cry to uplift your mood.
